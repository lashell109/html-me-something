         <h2>Manny</h2>
         <p>Manny is 7 years old and our youngest child and is about to start 2nd grade. He loves baseball, fishing and riding his bike. 
            He loves studying the weather so I think when he gets older that he will become a meteorologist.</p>
         <h2>Aaliyah</h2>
         <p>Aaliyah is our baby daughter entering the 4th grade. Yes, although she's 9 years old, our baby...lol! Aaliyah loves arts and crafts, she can do them all day literally. 
            She also loves doing gymnastics and we are hoping that she will be an Olympic Gold Medalist one day.
         </p>
         <h2>Cameron</h2>
         <p>Cameron is 15 years old and will be a sophomore when school starts here shortly. He loves basketball and can tell you the stats of any player on any team if you ask. 
            He is very good at mathematics and have won a few awards in grade school as the best mathematician.
         </p>
         <h2>Christopher</h2>
         <p>My oldest son Christopher 20 years old is currently in the Missouri Army National Guard. He is also in school to become an engineer. Thank you son for serving our country. 
            So proud of the man he has become.</p>
         <h2>Christee</h2>
         <p>My daughter Christee is 21 years old and is currently in school studying Criminal Justice. I knew she would get into this field one day because she always loved watching 
            mysteries and unsolved crimes shows with me.</p>
         <h2>Chelsee</h2>
         <p>Chelsee is my 23 years old daughter and the mother of my only grandchildren. I have 2 granddaughters, ages 1 & 2. Chelsee is currently in school studying graphic design.
            So proud of her for getting back to school and pursuing her dream.</p>
         <h2>Cydnee</h2>
         <p>Cydnee is my oldest child and is just turned 24 years old. She just graduated for college, passed her State Board and is officially a RN (registered nurse).
            She decided to stay in Springfield, Missouri to take a position as a RN in the Neuro Trauma Intensive Care Unit. Can you say that I'm one proud momma!
